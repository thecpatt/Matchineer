            <h2>What is Matchineer?</h2>
            <p>Matchineer is a service for all students at App State to develop connections with each other. It works by having users fill
                out a form with basic personal information, your passions or interests, and a short personality test. This data will then
                be used to compare users with one another, finding similarities to pair form applicants. You will then be given your match
                results on the summary page (make sure to record these before leaving the page). Whether you are a freshman or a graduate 
                student, Matchineer can work for you!
